This is a short demo of our project. 
First we start our flask server. Follow the app route to the localhost directory.
Here is our homepage, user can upload their image and check for the lipstick.
After the processing, the result will be return accroding to their similarity.
Then, user can use information they get to further search for the lipstick's detail 
such as price and where to buy.
They can always upload another photo to find the matching lipstick.
